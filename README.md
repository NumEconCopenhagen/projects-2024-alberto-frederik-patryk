This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from The US Federal Reserve on interest rates and compare the calculated theoretical rate of the Federal Bank to the historical rate.
3. Model project. Using Pindyck's Oil Cartel Model we find the optimal pricing and extraction of oil. We extend the default model with an oil exploration dynamic.
