# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Pindyck's Oil Cartel Model** and is about finding the optimal pricing and extraction of oil for
an oil cartel. We extend the default model with an oil exploration dynamic.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
