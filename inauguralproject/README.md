# Exchange Economy Project

## Project Overview

This project examines a simple economic model of an exchange economy with two consumers, A and B, and two goods, x1 and x2. The objective is to solve and simulate the model, visualize the results, and present the findings. The project involves applying numerical solution methods, structuring the code effectively, documenting the code, and presenting the results in text form and figures.

## Content

The project consists of the following main tasks:

1. **Illustrate Pareto Improvements**: Find and plot the set of allocations that are Pareto improvements over the initial endowment.
2. **Market Clearing Conditions**: Calculate and plot the errors in market clearing conditions and find the market clearing price.
3. **Optimal Allocations**: Determine the optimal allocations for consumers A and B under various scenarios.
4. **Aggregate Utility Maximization**: Find the allocations that maximize aggregate utility and compare them to other results.
5. **Random Initial Endowments**: Simulate and plot random initial endowments and find the equilibria for each case.

## Repository Structure

- **exchange_economy.py**: Contains all the core logic, function definitions, and visualizations.
- **inaugural_project_notebook.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that calls the functions from `exchange_economy.py` and displays the results.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
